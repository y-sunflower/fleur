The project is organized as follow:

- `fleur/` contains core files (`betweenstats.py`, `scatterstats.py`, etc) at its root.
- `fleur/_utils/` contains various utility files. They can be about statistics, dataviz or something else.
- `fleur/data/` contains the datasets distributed with the package.
