`fleur` is highly inspired by the following packages:

- [`ggstatsplot`](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/): an R package that extends `ggplot2` to add statistical details to plots.
- [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): the famous high-level interface of matplotlib for statistical data visualization.
