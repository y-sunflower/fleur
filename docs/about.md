## Inspirations

`fleur` is highly inspired by the following projects:

- [`ggstatsplot`](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/){target="\_blank"}: an R package that extends `ggplot2` to add statistical details to plots.
- [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/){target="\_blank"}: the famous high-level interface of matplotlib for statistical data visualization.
- [`statannotations`](https://github.com/trevismd/statannotations){target="\_blank"}: a `seaborn` extension that adds statistical annotations.

`fleur` aims to provide some differences:

- being both **super easy to use** (automatically detect which test to use and make nice plots by default, for instance), while letting you **control over everything**.
- being more **lightweight**: it only relies on [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/){target="\_blank"} (for dataviz), [`scipy`](https://scipy.org/){target="\_blank"} (for stats) and [`narwhals`](https://narwhals-dev.github.io/narwhals/){target="\_blank"} (for data handling).
